# Requirements Met

## User can click on the cookie to increase cookie count.
There is a cookie, and you can click it. I'm in awe.

## Cookie counter raises every second (default 1).
I didn't want to have a technical flat 1 cps, so I start the user with 1 auto-clicker. It does increase the price of Auto-Clicker right away, but only by 1.

## Progress saved in local storage.
Progress is saved once every 10 seconds into local storage. I thought, "maybe re-saving every second is a little much" so I slowed it down.

## The user can purchase upgrades, and they affect cookies per second.
I referred to mine as "Buildings", like in the original cookie clicker. 

# Extra

## Stying
I did some styling stuff, though not too much to be impressive. It looks okay, I think.

## More Upgrades
I did add upgrades, in the style of the upgrades from actual cookie clicker. They increase the efficiency of your buildings by 2x however many of the upgrade you have.

# Issues & Thoughts

## Issues
I had some trouble with classes, as I chose to learn them and play with those a little bit. I initially wanted to use inheritance with the upgrades, but I couldn't figure it out so I just used a for loop for them.

I actually spent a considerable amount of time on the small amount of styling I was doing. My greatest weakness right now is definitely CSS, so I'll focus more on that for the time being.

## Thoughts
This was fun! I'm from a game-dev background, so making games is always super engaging for me. I wanted to accomplish more, but I wouldn't have been able to do what I've done here three weeks ago in such a short amount of time.
